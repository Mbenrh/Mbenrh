# Hey, I'm Mariem! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently a third-year Computer Science student, and I'm excited to share my journey with you! 
Feel free to follow my GitHub to stay updated on my coding adventures.

## About Me:

Iâ€™ve always been passionate about technology and programming. Over the past two years at university, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to dive into a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on mastering Python and TensorFlow, with a keen interest in machine learning and data science.

I love being involved in university life, and I actively participate in several organizations and clubs, including:

* Enactus: where we work on social entrepreneurship projects
* Google Club: discussing the latest tech trends
* MLact: dedicated to machine learning
* Rtts Robotics: getting hands-on with robotics
* CyberSicca: Learning about cybersecurity
* Scout: Participating in community service and leadership activities

Recently, I completed a volunteer internship with AIESEC, which was an incredible experience that not only helped me grow my skills but also opened my eyes to different cultures and perspectives.

## My Dreams:
+ Continuous Improvement: I believe in lifelong learning and always look for ways to grow, both personally and professionally.
+ Startup Aspirations: One of my dreams is to start my own tech company that focuses on creating innovative and practical applications to solve real-world problems.
+ Cultural Exploration: Iâ€™m also passionate about traveling and experiencing new cultures, which I believe enriches our understanding of the world.

I would love to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on exciting projects!
